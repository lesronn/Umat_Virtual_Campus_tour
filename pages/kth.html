          <p>
            Dr. Kofi Tetteh hall was constructed as a GETFund project in 2014.
            It was purported to house about 540 students. The hall was named in
            honour of the second principal of the then KNUST School of Mines,
            now University of Mines and Technology. This is noted as the largest
            residential hall on campus with the finest rooms. The hall houses a
            number of provision stores, printing press and a bistro to serve
            students. In addition to this, there are several TV rooms and study
            rooms. The hall has about 4 floor compartments and located at the
            southern part of the UMaT campus. In this project, a 3D model of the
            Dr. Kofi Tetteh hall was simulated
